18. One of the advantages of using GitHub is the ability to create branches or copies of your project while you are making
 changes. By default a "<strong>main</strong>" branch is created when you add a GitHub repository. You can create additional branches 
like a "<strong>dev</strong>" or development branch that is a duplicate of your "<strong>main</strong>" branch. 
You then make changes to your "<strong>dev</strong>" branch. 
Once you have reviewed and tested those changes you can <strong>commit</strong>
those changes to the main branch. Let's now create a "<strong>dev</strong>" or development branch. Click on "New branch"
