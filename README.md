18. One of the advantages of using GitHub is the ability to create branches or copies of your project while you are making
 changes. By default a "<strong>main</strong>" branch is created when you add a GitHub repository. You can create additional branches 
like a "<strong>dev</strong>" or development branch that is a duplicate of your "<strong>main</strong>" branch. 
You then make changes to your "<strong>dev</strong>" branch. 
Once you have reviewed and tested those changes you can <strong>commit</strong>
those changes to the main branch. Let's now create a "<strong>dev</strong>" or development branch. Click on "New branch"

locally as well as running all of the other Git commands that GitHub Desktop is built upon.

local file will get pushed to GitHub in the cloud.

29. Now that your changes have been pushed to GitHub we can create a pull request. By pushing the "Pull Request" button
you are submitting a request to have your code reviewed and if approved, your changes will be merged from the dev branch
into the main branch.

30. Your GitHub repository is then launched in a web browser. GitHub analyzes your code to see if there are any conflicts
with other pull requests which may have been made by other developers. That is one of the advantages of GitHub. It will
track and manage changes made by multiple developers working on the same code repository.
